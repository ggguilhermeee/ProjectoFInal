# Project Overview

This project serves as the culmination of my Bachelor's in Computer Engineering. While I'm proud of this accomplishment, there are areas I would revisit for improvement if time allows.

## Areas for Improvement

1. **Security Enhancement:**
   - Remove sensitive database credentials from production server configurations.

2. **Testing:**
   - Strengthen unit tests and integration tests for better code coverage.

3. **Code Quality:**
   - Eliminate unnecessary comments in the code.
   - Enhance variable and method names for improved readability.

4. **Deployment:**
   - Containerize the server application for easier deployment and scalability.

5. **Code Structure:**
   - Investigate and implement a more effective application structure.
